	<h1> POST-COVID, HOUSING PRICES HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY IN SPRINGS </h1>
	<p>
			Springs is  one of the few working-class neighborhoods in the Hamptons. Unlike other areas, where large swaths of the properties are left vacant for the winter months while their residents are in the city, Springs is home to a population of year-round residents. These are individuals who do the jobs that are critical to the functioning of any town; the teachers, grocery-store workers, shopkeepers, librarians, etc.

		<p> But during Covid-19, NYC families flocked to the Hamptons, buying up property in a bid to trade confinement in their apartments for a house near the beach. And although many of those families have since put their pandemic houses up for sale or rent and moved back to the city, the toll on real estate pricing has stuck.

During this frenzy, a younger set of New York residents began to understand Springs as a ‘cool’ place to be– different from the stifling East, South, and Bridge Hamptons where their parents country club. Indeed, many famous artists have lived and worked in Springs, including Jackson Pollack, Lee Krasner, and Willem and Elaine de Kooning. Chic New Yorkers were attracted to the more rustic, “real” feel of the tiny fishing village with such deep artistic roots. And like any gentrification story, the hip coffee shop/ variety store was quickly established, creating a hub for young creatives to sip $9 lattes and purchase bespoke ceramics inspired by the land.
